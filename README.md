SALINE LAGOON ANALYSIS

BACKGROUND INFO
Saline lagoons are intertidal environments of reduced water exchange. This study focused on an isolated saline lagoon in Llanelli, South Wales and is detached from the sea for 
the majority of the month except during high spring tides where the sea level rises above the bank height and floods the lagoon. 
Seasonal variation in community structure in intertidal habitats is well documented. Increases in water temperature, nutrient and food availability during the autumn tends to 
increase biodiveristy in similar environments. However, greater influx of salt water into the lagoons at certain times of the month could also influence community structure, 
these changes between flooding phases have not been investigated. 
Some of the potential triggers for these temporal changes in the community are temperature, salinity, pH, turbidity, oxygen availablity and nutrient concentration.

The aim of this study was to determine the causes of temporal changes in community structure in saline lagoons. 
Both monthly changes in community structure and changes over different flooding phases were investigated.
